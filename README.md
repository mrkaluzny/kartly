## Design Decisions

- **Server-side rendering:** Ensuring the app is performant

- **Caching:TanStack Query:** Improving the UX

- **CSS framework: Tailwind**: UI design consistency

- **Code formatting and quality: Prettier and Git-hooks** Maintaining code quality and consistency

- **Branching model: Git-flow**

## Code Structure

Using modular and component-based architecture.

## File Structure

```sh
